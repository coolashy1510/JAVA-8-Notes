- A class can extend only one class at a time
- An interface can extend any number of interfaces at a time
- A class can implement any number of interfaces
- A class can extend another class and can implement any number of instances simultaneously.

A extends B :- A and B can be class or interface
A extends B,C :- Interfaces
A implements B,C :- A--> class B,C--> interfaces
A extends B implements C,D :- A,B --> classes C,D --> interfaces.
A implements C,D extends B :- Compiler Error (First we should use extends and then only we can use implements)

Inheritance:
Extends means parent to child. (we are getting something from parent)
Implements means child to parent. (we have to give something to parent)

Interface methods:
  - every method present inside an interface is always public and abstract whether we are declaring or not.
  - if we dont mention anything it is considered as public.
