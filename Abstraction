**interface and abstract:**
- interface will have many methods. few could have body and many might be empty methods.
when we intend to implement an interface in any class, we need to have all the methods again in order to compile. we cannot be specific in implementing the methods.
- when creating and declaring another class as abstract, we can implement all the methods from the interface class.
- so now when we can extend the abstract class and use the only required methods despite using all the methods that are un wanted.
